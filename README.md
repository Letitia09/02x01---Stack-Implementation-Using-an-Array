# 02x01---Stacks-Using-an-Array
<font size=13><b>Problem statement</b></font><br>
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. We will be learning about LIFO (Last In First Out) Stacks.
Your task is to implement the stack data structure using an array. Your implementation must include the following functions :

NOTE:
-All the functions must have an 0(1) running complexity.
-You are not responsible for taking any input or output.
-You are not supposed to modify any part of the code except the BODY.
-Leave the HEAD and TAIL of the code untouched.
-Name of the functions/variables must remain unchanged.
